DogeLaunchPad
=============

a windows application for easily launching dogecoin with some advanced parameters


This application is written in Autohotkey. Its only about 100 lines and should be fairly easy to read. I'd strongly recommend that you DO read and understand it, just like anything crypto related. How else do you know I'm not stealing all
ur dogez? You dont. So read it.

(But I'm not stealing ur dogez)

I'll include a compiled binary in the full releases, but seriously. AutoHotKey is the tits. Just install it and use the latest AHK file.


The application displays a graphic. Its a 300x300 px PNG file (doge.png) . I include one in the major releases, but you can use anything you like obviously. If you've come up with something awesome I'd be glad to use it. Contact me.


YES - This application WILL work fine with any other major *-QT fork. Im sure it would come in handy for both Litecoin and Bitcoin.


Thats about it for now.
